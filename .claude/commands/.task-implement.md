Your task is to implement a feature based on the provided implementation plan. Your goal is to create a solid and well-organized implementation that includes appropriate validation, error handling, and follows all logical steps described in the plan.

First, carefully review the provided implementation plan:

<implementation_plan>
@docs\api-implementation-plan\email-notifications-implementation-plan.md
</implementation_plan>

<types>
@SantaVibe.Backend\SantaVibe.Api\Data\Entities\
</types>

<implementation_rules>
@docs\backend-guidelines.md
</implementation_rules>

<implementation_approach>
Implement a maximum of 3 steps from the implementation plan, briefly summarize what you've done, and describe the plan for the next 3 actions - stop work at this point and wait for my feedback.
</implementation_approach>

Now implement it
