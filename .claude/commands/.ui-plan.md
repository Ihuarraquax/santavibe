As a senior frontend developer, your task is to create a detailed implementation plan for a new view in a web application. This plan should be comprehensive and clear enough for another frontend developer to implement the view correctly and efficiently.

First, review the following information:

2. View Description:
<view_description>
#### 2.1.3 Invitation View (Public)
- **Path:** `/invite/{token}`
- **Main Purpose:** Display group details before authentication and join group after authentication
- **Authentication Required:** No (for viewing), Yes (for joining)
- **Key Information to Display:**
  - **Unauthenticated State:**
    - Group name
    - Organizer name
    - Current participant count
    - CTAs: "Login to Join" or "Register to Join"
  - **Authenticated State (Auto-triggered join flow):**
    - Same group information
    - Budget suggestion field (optional)
    - "Join Group" button

- **Key View Components:**
  - InvitationDetailsComponent
  - BudgetSuggestionInputComponent
  - LoadingSpinnerComponent (during join operation)
  - ErrorAlertComponent

- **UX Considerations:**
  - Token stored during registration flow for seamless auto-join
  - After auth, automatically show join form
  - Budget suggestion is optional (can be empty)
  - Clear messaging if invitation expired (410) or invalid (404)
  - Success redirects to group details page

- **Security:**
  - Token validated server-side
  - Cannot join same group twice (409 error handled)
  - Cannot join after draw completed (410 error)
  - No sensitive information exposed before auth

</view_description>

3. User Stories:
<user_stories>
FR-012: Joining a Group
- Users can join a group by accessing the unique invitation link
- If not authenticated, users are prompted to register or log in
- Upon joining, users provide their anonymous budget suggestion
- Users can see basic group information (name, organizer, participant count)

US-016: Join Group via Invitation Link
Title: Accept invitation to join Secret Santa group

Description:
As a user (registered or new), I want to join a Secret Santa group via an invitation link so that I can participate in the gift exchange.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I have received an invitation link
- When I click the link
- Then if I'm not logged in, I'm prompted to register or log in
- And after authentication, I see the group details (name, organizer, participants)
- And I'm prompted to enter my budget suggestion
- And upon submitting, I'm added to the group as a participant
- And I receive confirmation that I successfully joined

Edge cases:
- Link is invalid or expired: show error message
- User is already in the group: redirect to group page with message
- Link is used after draw is completed: show error that group is closed
- Budget suggestion is required to complete joining process (can be left empty)
</user_stories>

4. Endpoint Description:
<endpoint_description>
#### Get Invitation Details

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/invitations/{token}`

**Description**: Retrieve group information for an invitation link. Used before joining to show group details.

**Authentication**: None (public endpoint, but user must be authenticated to join)

**Path Parameters**:
- `token` (UUID): Invitation token from the shareable link

**Success Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "invitationToken": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d",
  "groupId": "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7",
  "groupName": "Family Secret Santa 2025",
  "organizerName": "Jan Kowalski",
  "participantCount": 5,
  "drawCompleted": false,
  "isValid": true
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404 Not Found`: Invalid token or group not found
  ```json
  {
    "error": "InvalidInvitation",
    "message": "This invitation link is invalid or has expired"
  }
  ```
- `410 Gone`: Draw already completed
  ```json
  {
    "error": "InvitationExpired",
    "message": "This group has already completed the draw and is no longer accepting participants"
  }
  ```

5. Endpoint Implementation:
<endpoint_implementation>
@SantaVibe.Backend\SantaVibe.Api\Features\Groups\Invitations
</endpoint_implementation>


7. Tech Stack:
<tech_stack>
@docs/tech-stack.md  
</tech_stack>

8. UI plan:
<ui_plan>
@docs/ui-plan.md  
</ui_plan>

Before creating the final implementation plan, conduct analysis and planning inside <implementation_breakdown> tags in your thinking block. This section can be quite long, as it's important to be thorough.

In your implementation breakdown, execute the following steps:
1. For each input section (PRD, User Stories, Endpoint Description, Endpoint Implementation, Type Definitions, Tech Stack):
  - Summarize key points
 - List any requirements or constraints
 - Note any potential challenges or important issues
2. Extract and list key requirements from the PRD
3. List all needed main components, along with a brief description of their purpose, needed types, handled events, and validation conditions
4. Create a high-level component tree diagram
5. Identify required DTOs and custom ViewModel types for each view component. Explain these new types in detail, breaking down their fields and associated types.
6. Identify potential state variables and custom hooks, explaining their purpose and how they'll be used
7. List required API calls and corresponding frontend actions
8. Map each user story to specific implementation details, components, or functions
9. List user interactions and their expected outcomes
10. List conditions required by the API and how to verify them at the component level
11. Identify potential error scenarios and suggest how to handle them
12. List potential challenges related to implementing this view and suggest possible solutions

After conducting the analysis, provide an implementation plan in Markdown format with the following sections:

1. Overview: Brief summary of the view and its purpose.
2. View Routing: Specify the path where the view should be accessible.
3. Component Structure: Outline of main components and their hierarchy.
4. Component Details: For each component, describe:
 - Component description, its purpose and what it consists of
 - Main HTML elements and child components that build the component
 - Handled events
 - Validation conditions (detailed conditions, according to API)
 - Types (DTO and ViewModel) required by the component
 - Props that the component accepts from parent (component interface)
5. Types: Detailed description of types required for view implementation, including exact breakdown of any new types or view models by fields and types.
6. State Management: Detailed description of how state is managed in the view, specifying whether a custom hook is required.
7. API Integration: Explanation of how to integrate with the provided endpoint. Precisely indicate request and response types.
8. User Interactions: Detailed description of user interactions and how to handle them.
9. Conditions and Validation: Describe what conditions are verified by the interface, which components they concern, and how they affect the interface state
10. Error Handling: Description of how to handle potential errors or edge cases.
11. Implementation Steps: Step-by-step guide for implementing the view.

Ensure your plan is consistent with the PRD, user stories, and includes the provided tech stack.

The final output should be in English and saved in a file named docs/web-implementation-plan/{view-name}-view-implementation-plan.md. Do not include any analysis and planning in the final output.

Here's an example of what the output file should look like (content is to be replaced):

```markdown
# View Implementation Plan [View Name]

[Brief description of the view and its purpose]

## 2. View Routing

```

Begin analysis and planning now. Your final output should consist solely of the implementation plan in English in markdown format, which you will save in the docs/web-implementation-plan/{view-name}-view-implementation-plan.md file and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the implementation breakdown.
