SantaVibe addresses the financial burden of buying gifts for everyone during holiday seasons by organizing a draw where each participant becomes a "Santa" for exactly one other person. The application provides:

- **Anonymous draw system** - Even organizers don't know the pairings

- **AI-powered gift suggestions** - Based on wishlists and budget
- **Budget management** - With anonymous participant suggestions

**Target Market:**

### Running the Application

**Development Mode:**

Frontend (Angular):
```bash
cd SantaVibe.Web
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

Backend (.NET):
```bash
cd SantaVibe.API
dotnet run
```
The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001`

## Available Scripts

All scripts are run from the `SantaVibe.Web` directory:

### `npm start`
Runs the Angular development server. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`
Builds the Angular application for production to the `dist/` folder. It correctly bundles Angular in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run watch`
Runs the build in watch mode with development configuration. Useful for continuous development without the dev server overhead.

### `npm test`
Launches the Karma test runner in interactive watch mode. Runs unit tests using Jasmine.

### `npm run lint`
Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues and enforce coding standards. Uses the project's ESLint configuration with Prettier integration.

### `npm run ng`
Provides direct access to the Angular CLI for additional commands (generate components, services, etc.).
