### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE

- Strictly separate code into layers: domain, application (use cases), infrastructure, and frameworks
- Ensure dependencies point inward, with inner layers having no knowledge of outer layers
- Implement domain entities that encapsulate {{business_rules}} without framework dependencies
- Use interfaces (ports) and implementations (adapters) to isolate external dependencies
- Create use cases that orchestrate entity interactions for specific business operations
- Use 'vertical slice' approach to keep project structure oriented for use cases instead of technicalities like 'Validators', 'DTOs' etc.
- Implement mappers to transform data between layers to maintain separation of concerns

#### ADR

- Create ADRs in /docs/adr/{name}.md for:
- 1) Major dependency changes
- 2) Architectural pattern changes
- 3) New integration patterns
- 4) Database schema changes

#### DDD

- Create rich domain models with behavior, not just data structures, for {{core_domain_entities}}
- Use value objects for concepts with no identity but defined by their attributes
- Use aggregates to enforce consistency boundaries and transactional integrity

### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### C#
- Use primary constructors

#### ENTITY_FRAMEWORK

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}

#### ASP_NET

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints in .NET 6+ applications to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the mediator pattern with MediatR for decoupling request handling and simplifying cross-cutting concerns
- Use API controllers with model binding and validation attributes for {{complex_data_models}}
- Apply proper response caching with cache profiles and ETags for improved performance on {{high_traffic_endpoints}}
- Implement proper exception handling with ExceptionFilter or middleware to provide consistent error responses
- Use dependency injection with scoped lifetime for request-specific services and singleton for stateless services
