  Context

  You are an expert in creating proof of concept for web applications. Your task is to create a minimal PoC for SantaVibe - a platform for organizing Secret Santa draws.

  PoC Scope - Minimal Functionality

  1. Groups (MUST HAVE)

  - Create group
  - Generate unique invitation link
  - Join group via link
  - List of group participants
  - Set budget by organizer (without participant suggestions for PoC)

  2. Wishlists (MUST HAVE)

  - Text field for entering wishlist
  - Save/edit wishlist
  - Display assigned person's wishlist (after draw)

  3. Draw (MUST HAVE - SIMPLIFIED)

  - "Start Draw" button for organizer
  - Simple draw algorithm:
    - Each participant gets exactly one person
    - No one can draw themselves
    - NO exclusion rules (simplification for PoC)
    - NO validation for 2-person cycles (simplification for PoC)
  - Display assigned person after draw
  - Anonymity of results (everyone sees only their assignment)

  4. Basic UI (MUST HAVE)

  - Group view (different before and after draw)
  - Create group form
  - Join via link page
  - Display assignment and wishlist

  EXCLUDED from PoC (OUT OF SCOPE)

  - ‚ùå Auth
  - ‚ùå Email notifications
  - ‚ùå AI gift suggestions
  - ‚ùå Exclusion rules (pairs cannot draw each other)
  - ‚ùå Draw feasibility validation
  - ‚ùå Budget suggestions from participants
  - ‚ùå Wishlist change notifications
  - ‚ùå Removing participants
  - ‚ùå GDPR checkbox and terms
  - ‚ùå Email verification
  - ‚ùå Advanced business rules validation
  - ‚ùå CI/CD and deployment

  Technical Requirements

  Frontend

  - Tailwind CSS + Flowbite for UI

  Database

  - In-memoryfor simplicity

  IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

  üî¥ BEFORE STARTING TO CODE:

  1. PLAN YOUR WORK - present a detailed implementation plan including:
  2. GET MY APPROVAL - wait for my confirmation before starting to code
  3. ONLY THEN start creating the code

  Expectations from PoC:

  - ‚úÖ Working basic flow: create group ‚Üí invite ‚Üí draw ‚Üí result
  - ‚úÖ Simple, clean code (this is PoC, not production)
  - ‚úÖ Minimal styling (Tailwind + Flowbite)
  - ‚úÖ No advanced validation and error handling (basic error handling is enough)
  - ‚úÖ Data in memory
  - ‚úÖ Easy to run locally

  PoC Goal:

  Verify that the basic app concept works, the draw algorithm is correct, and the user flow makes sense. This should be the foundation on which we'll build the full MVP.
